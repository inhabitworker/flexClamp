# Circular Clamp

This clamp is intended to exert forces between two plates via its circular body, the "spring", by starting off practically closed and in this way pre-tensioned?

There's probably a seriously cool "compliant" way of doing this without the axles. That would own hard style. Some kind of element that pulls the inside of the "plates" to get them to orient straightly. Ya understand me?

This is mainly for my ADXL345, really. It would probably have ADXL345 holes/ extension in the damn thing - optionally.
